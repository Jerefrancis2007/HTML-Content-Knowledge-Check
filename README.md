I created a Knowledge Check HTML file with all the components asked for within this assignment.
First I created a form for The Coding Temple so the user would beable to provide some information of who ther are and how they were able to find us.
Within this form I made it a requirment that there was something place within the the email and name inputs.
I also placed a place holder in the comments section so they know to leave text there.
Next I created a nav bar that would direct the user to different points within the page. I tested the link to ensure that this funtion worked.
Next I created a table that would let the user know the three options for pricing.
Lastly I created two images (one standard and one that was styled with a rounded border).
I added a margin right to the first one so that the second image would not look off putting on the page.
I also added a footer at the bottom of the page to make it seem as if it was a real webpage.
I did use a genrated lorem text for the sections so that i can test to see the pages movement with longer text within the <p> tags.
I did want to have the comment box larger but couldnt find a way to do it without using css and since we have not got that far yet I didnt want to waist too much time styling the page.
